This is a quick react boilerplate to get started.

I build this for myself, since I didn't want to use the bloated `create-react-app` (btw 220mb dependencies compared to 3.9).

If you want to use this, beware: I'm a Backend Developer by Day. Recommendations are always welcome.


I use [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling, seems nice and easy for simple stuff...

`npm i -g parcel`

`parcel serve public/index.html`
